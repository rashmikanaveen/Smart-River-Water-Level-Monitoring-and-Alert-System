Affordable, maintainable river water level gauge with Alert System


![System Architecture](assets/system-architecture.png)

## Project Summary

This project presents a cost-effective and maintainable river water level monitoring and alert system. It is specifically designed for deployment in remote or rural areas where conventional solutions are either too expensive, require complex maintenance, or rely heavily on satellite communication.

The system uses a combination of low-power hardware and modern wireless communication technologies to continuously monitor water levels and issue alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

---

## Objectives

- Develop a reliable, low-cost system for real-time river water level monitoring.
- Reduce dependency on high-maintenance and high-cost systems.
- Enable location-tagged data reporting through GPS.
- Provide local (on-site) alerts and remote alerts via MQTT.
- Ensure suitability for harsh, moisture-prone environments.

---

## Key Features

- Real-time river water level monitoring
- Location tagging using GPS
- Low-power NB-IoT-based cellular communication
- MQTT-based data publishing
- On-site audio alert system (buzzer/speaker)
- Compatibility with mobile and cloud-based dashboards
- Waterproof ultrasonic sensor suitable for outdoor environments

## Why ESP32?

While several microcontrollers are suitable for embedded IoT applications, this project uses the **ESP32** (without Wi-Fi/BLE) for several important reasons:

### Benefits of Using ESP32:

- **Dual-core processor** (Tensilica Xtensa LX6) ‚Üí allows concurrent tasks (e.g., sensor polling + NB-IoT communication)
- **More Flash/RAM** than STM32 Blue Pill ‚Üí easier for MQTT, GPS parsing, sensor filtering
- **Supports multiple UARTs** ‚Üí useful when using GPS, NB-IoT module, and debugging over serial
- **Good development ecosystem** ‚Üí widely supported in Arduino and ESP-IDF environments
- **Lower development time** due to rich libraries and community support

---

## System Architecture

1. The ESP32 reads water level data from the ultrasonic sensor.
2. The water level is calculated relative to a defined normal threshold.
3. If the level exceeds the threshold:
   - An on-site buzzer or speaker is activated.
   - Data is sent via MQTT using the NB-IoT module.
4. GPS coordinates are attached to each data packet.
5. A remote dashboard or app can visualize and monitor data in real time.

---

## Technical Advantages

- Uses NB-IoT for low power, long-range, and cost-efficient data transmission.
- MQTT protocol allows lightweight communication ideal for IoT applications.
- GPS-based station identification enables support for multiple monitoring sites.
- Waterproof sensor ensures durability in high-moisture outdoor environments.
- ESP32 allows easy firmware development and wireless integration.

## Application Scenarios

- River and canal monitoring for flood-prone areas
- Water level logging for environmental agencies
- Smart agriculture and irrigation control
- Early warning systems for disaster management

## üóìÔ∏è Project Plan ‚Äì Water Level Monitoring System

| **Week** | **Tasks** |
|----------|----------|
| **Week 1** | ‚Ä¢ Finalize the project idea and use case.<br>‚Ä¢ Define high-level objectives (e.g., monitor, alert, transmit water level). |
| **Week 2** | ‚Ä¢ Reword ‚ÄúRead research papers‚Äù ‚Üí **‚ÄúRead 2‚Äì3 key research papers on wireless water level systems, especially focusing on cellular communication limitations, delay, and rural deployment challenges.‚Äù** |
| **Week 3** | ‚Ä¢ Make a **comparison table** for different sensor types (e.g., ultrasonic vs. float vs. pressure), cellular modules (e.g., SIM7000 vs. EC-01), and their compatibility with ESP32. |
| **Week 4** | ‚Ä¢ Along with block diagram and system design, **start drawing simple circuit diagrams** to speed up hardware testing in Week 5. |
| **Week 5** | ‚Ä¢ While testing each component, also **log power consumption** of sensors, ESP32, and the cellular module.<br>‚Ä¢ This data will help design power management in Week 10. |
| **Week 6** | ‚Ä¢ Use **threshold-based logic** for water levels (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).<br>‚Ä¢ Simulate different water levels to validate buzzer triggers.<br>‚Ä¢ Start modularizing the code for clarity. |
